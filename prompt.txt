Create an interaction with the provided files.

Provided Files:
• Access the ids in the svgs to successfully make interaction. Ids in this prompt will be referred to with {} around the id names.
• {phone-frame} acts as a scrolling frame. Fit to full-size of the screen, and scrolling down moves down {phone-frame}.

Interaction:
• The interaction starts with {setup}. {restart} is hidden.
• At the start, {planet-1-text}, {planet-2-text}, {blackhole-text}, {dyingstar-text}, {stardust-1-text}, {stardust-2-text}, {stardust-3-text}, {instruction-prompt}, {outro-text}, {star-pass}, {planet-1-nextbutton}, {planet-2-nextbutton}, {blackhole-nextbutton}, {dyingstar-nextbutton}, {stardust-1-nextbutton}, {stardust-2-nextbutton}, {stardust-3-nextbutton} are hidden.
• If the user clicks the up, down, left, or right keys on their keyboard, {intro-text} fades away upwards, and {star} can now be controlled by the user with the aforementioned keys.
• {star} cannot overlap any of the {barrier} and {boundary} elements in the assets.
• {easteregg} hovers up and down slowly and subtly.

• If {star} makes contact with {stardust-1}, {star} is temporarily disabled from user control, and {stardust-1-text} and {stardust-1-nextbutton} fades into visibility. {stardust-1-nextbutton} hovers up and down slowly and subtly. {stardust-1-text} begins with just {stardust-1-text-1} visible with the rest of its components hidden.
